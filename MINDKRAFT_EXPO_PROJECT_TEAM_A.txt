MINDKRAFT EXPO PROJECT [TEAM A] 

➢  Problem Statement 

Students with temporary physical injuries such as fractures or post-surgery conditions 
face difficulty in writing exams manually. Dependence on human scribes affects privacy 
and independence, while existing exam systems lack flexible support for such students. 
Hence, a secure and voice-based examination system is required to ensure equal 
academic opportunities. 

➢  Proposed Solution 

A Speech-to-Text Examination Assistant enables completely hands-free exam taking. 
Students use face recognition for secure login, followed by IVR-style voice 
navigation (numbered menu options) to dictate answers. The system automatically 
reads questions aloud using eSpeak TTS, processes speech via Vosk/Whisper STT, 
formats answers intelligently using Llama LLM, and operates in fullscreen kiosk 
mode to prevent cheating. 

➢  Features of the System 

1.  Face Recognition Login - Secure biometric authentication using webcam 

2.  IVR-Style Voice Navigation - Numbered menu system (1=Answer, 2=Read again, 

3=Next, etc.) 

3.  Automatic Question Reading - eSpeak TTS reads entire question paper 

sequentially 

4.  Real-time Speech-to-Text - Vosk for commands, Whisper/Vosk for answers 

5.  AI Text Formatting - Llama3.2 LLM adds punctuation, capitalization, grammar 

correction 

6.  Hands-free Operation - Zero keyboard/mouse required from login to submission 

7.  Fullscreen Kiosk Mode - Locks other applications, prevents Alt+Tab 

8.  Auto-save with Timestamps - Prevents data loss, audit trail for authorities 

9.  Offline Operation - All components work without internet 

10. Multi-language Support - Vosk models + multilingual LLM 

11. Activity Logging - Complete audit trail with timestamps

➢  Workflow Diagram 

1.App Start 

Student opens the exam app. 

2.Face Login 

Webcam scans face → verifies student → allows entry. 

3.Exam Initialization 

Questions load → system announces start. 

4.Question Reading 

System reads: 

•  Question 

• 

IVR menu options 

5. IVR (Interactive Voice Recognition) Menu 

Student hears: 

“Press 1 to answer, 2 to repeat…” 

6. Voice Command 

Student speaks number → Vosk detects. 

7. Two Possible Paths 

▶ If Navigation 

•  Next 

•  Previous 

•  Repeat 

→ Go back to question reading. 

▶ If Answer 

→ Dictation mode starts. 

8. Dictation Mode 

Student speaks answer → STT converts. 

9. AI Formatting 

Llama improves grammar & structure. 

10. Auto Save 

Answer saved with time + ID. 

11.Loop 

System goes back to menu for next question. 

12. Submission 

At end → student submits. 

13. Lock System 

App locks → only admin can exit.
